    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <p>Born and raised in Greensboro, NC, I first moved to Raleigh in August of 2020 to begin studying at NC State! Ever
        since I was young, I've had an interest in how things work and fit together. For that reason I decided to choose
        Mechanical Engineering as my major. After taking a class in MATLAB, I realized my love for programming and
        decided to add a minor for it. I plan to graduate in May of 2025.</p>
    <p>I am currently looking for Summer 2023 internship or job opportunities, so if you have a position that my skills
        would be a good fit for please reach out!</p>
